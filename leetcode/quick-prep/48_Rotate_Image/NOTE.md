# Notes on Success
+ runtime : 32 ms (faster than 82.22% of python3 submissions)
+ memory : 14.1 MB (less than 83.15% of python3 submissions)

+ More of a math problem than problem solving :) 
 - Can't reduce time complexity from N^2, though some minor boosts can be made.

> Time : O(N^2) , Space : O(1)
