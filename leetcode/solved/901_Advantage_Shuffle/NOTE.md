# Notes on Success
+ runtime : 332 ms (faster than 90.81% of python3 submissions)
+ memory : 17.3 MB (less than 70.5% of python3 submissions)

+ Must sort and keep a single array of N
 - Maybe we can improve it by swapping in-place with some heuristics?
 - ex. 0 in N1 are always useless, 0 in N2 should be used on the smallest N1s, etc

> Time : O(NlogN) , Space : O(N)
