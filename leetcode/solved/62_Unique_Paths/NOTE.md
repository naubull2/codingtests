# Notes on Success

+ Just a combination of "right(R)" and "down(D)" sequences, where only 
  Rs and Ds are present, therefore a simple number of combination computation via factorial is needed.
  factorial contains O(N) multiplication for N.

> Time : O(M+N) , Space : O(1)

+ As a dynamic programming view, we can come up with a recurrence equation.

> Time : O(MN) , Space : O(MN)
