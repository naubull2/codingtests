# Notes on Success
+ BFS, DFS both solutions,
  - BFS will fare better on cases where shallow target sums are found
  - DFS will use less memory if the depth of the tree is not too deep
+ In general DFS recursion will work better in terms of readability, and average runtime.

> Time : O(N) , Space : O(depth)
