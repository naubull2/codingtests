# Notes on Success
+ runtime : 44 ms (faster than 65.58%% of python3 submissions)
+ memory :  14.2 MB (less than 95.67% of python3 submissions)

+ Simple code, readable method worked just fine, passing all tests in reasonable bound.
  In cases we can't afford more space, in-place swapping would work just fine. 
  
  Traverse the grid once, simple dynamic programming.
