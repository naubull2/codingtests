"""
In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

	The town judge trusts nobody.
	Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
	There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1

Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 1000
	0 <= trust.length <= 104
	trust[i].length == 2
	All the pairs of trust are unique.
	ai != bi
	1 <= ai, bi <= n
