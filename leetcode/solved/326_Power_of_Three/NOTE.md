# Notes on Success
+ runtime : 60 ms (faster than 96.53% of python3 submissions)
+ memory : 14.2 MB (less than 48.68% of python3 submissions)

+ If we loop until N, then it's log_3(N),
+ If we use the integer constraint, then it's O(1)

> Time : O(log3_(N)) , Space : O(1)
> Time : O(1) , Space : O(1)
