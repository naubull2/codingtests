# Notes on Success
+ runtime : 72 ms (faster than 92.67% of python3 submissions)
+ memory : 14.4 MB (less than 78.74% of python3 submissions)

+ Seems like reducing the search space is the key to making it faster,
  - can't get to remove the double for loop in the "x<y<z" cases

> Time : O(uniq(N)**2) , Space : O(N)
