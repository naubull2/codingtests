# Notes on Success

+ runtime : 200 ms (faster than 22.81% of python3 submissions)
+ memory : 17.2 MB (less than 42.44% of python3 submissions)

+ I pretty much ignored the length of each words in the wordlist AND queries...
  - Analysis may not be exactly O(M+N) if the words in the wordlists can grow significantly long

> Time : O(M+N) , Space : O(M+N)
